    "# Day 1: Morning Session\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Python section of the Advanced Topics in Scientific Programming (ATSP) 2024 course! \n",
    "\n",
    "We have two days of Python, where we will discuss the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Day 1 will focus on basics of Python, Numpy, Jupyter, and then machine learning methods using Sci-Kit Learn\n",
    "    - As I understand it, you you have already done Pandas in the introduction course?\n",
    "    - If we need a refresher on Pandas, we can do so quickly in this morning session now. \n",
    "- Day 2 will focus on Deep Learning, model deployment, and your assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment will be to complete an end to end machine learning project - you will have the choice of several assignments. We will go in to more details regarding the assignment tomorrow. One of the assignments will be an image classification assignment using deep neural networks. Another assignment will relate to text or tabular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Admin and Materials\n",
    "Let's first discuss some administrative matters and the material for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide the materials as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- All course materials are provided and presented as Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "- Jupyter is a web-based development enviroment for Python, R, etc.\n",
    "- During the seminars, we will use this server to run and execute the code live\n",
    "- Each of you has an account so you can log in to the server and access the materials and follow along while we code, you can also experiment with the code, etc.\n",
    "- The server will only run during the seminar times. Outside of the seminars, you will be able to access the notebooks via our GitHub repository\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that to run the notebooks outside of the seminar times, you will need to install and run Jupyter locally, or use something like Google Colab, which we discuss in detail tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon, we will discuss your assignment, and in this session we can set up Jupyter on your local machines, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will discuss the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is Jupyter and how to use it\n",
    "- Basics of Python\n",
    "- Basics of NumPy\n",
    "- Basics of Pandas, if required?\n",
    "- Machine Learning basics\n",
    "    - Classification, regression / Supervised vs. Unsupervised\n",
    "    - Overfitting and underfitting\n",
    "    - Model evalutation\n",
    "- SciKit Learn\n",
    "    - How to get data\n",
    "    - How to generate data\n",
    "    - Training, testing\n",
    "    - Cross validation\n",
    "    - Model persistence\n",
    "    - Scaling and normalisation\n",
    "    - Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We will split this content into the morning and afternoon sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a bit more detail, first we discuss Jupyter, and how to use it. We will use Jupyter almost entirely for this course, to cover the material, and to run code examples and so on. You can follow along and try code examples. Jupyter is a good skill to have if you work in data science, machine learning, or academic research in general. For example, it is very useful for reproducibility and for organising code, presenting work, and for development work when you are working on a project. You can use it as an IDE, and completely replace the use of a text editor. It is web-based, meaning all you need is a browser to use it. And it can be used remotely, for example you can code at home while accessing a server at work or anywhere else in the world. It is worth noting that Jupyter is not only for Python development, there are so-called kernels for dozens of languages, including R, Julia, MATLAB, Mathematica, SPSS, you name it! \n",
    "\n",
    "After covering Jupyter and how to use it, we cover the basics of Python. Python is a general purpose language, which makes it a very useful language to know - and of course it often used in the context of Machine Learning tasks, but it completely dominates as the language of choice for Deep Learning. If you are doing any kind of Deep Neural Network training, you will most likely be using Python and frameworks such as Torch and TensorFlow. So in this section we will cover the basics of Python, such as functions, lists, classes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have covered the basics of Python, then we will cover some tips and tricks for using Python in the context of Machine Learning, and cover some aspects of the language that make it useful for Data Science work in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we cover Numpy, which is a framework for handling data in Python. It provides essential functionality for manipulating array and matrix data and is used in practically any machine learing project. If required, we can cover Pandas as well, although I understand that this has already been covered in the \n",
    "\n",
    "After we have covered the basics of Python programming, Jupyter, and NumPy, we will move on to Machine Learning methods using Python. The focus of this course is practical Machine Learning. We will not discuss in detail how the algorithms we cover work, it is focussed on how to train algorithms, what are best practices, where to get data, etc. and we will be mostly using SciKit-Learn for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note**: these notebooks are rather text-heavy: this is by design. The reason being, is that it should be possible for you to download and read and go through all these noteooks completely independently after the course has finished. Hence they should be self explanatory and be useful as a reference later, if you wish to go back to a topic (for your assignment, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 2 will focus on Neural Networks and Deep Learning, as well as model deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple neural networks: we will use PyTorch to define a simple neural network and train it\n",
    "- PyTorch: we will discuss the framework we will use to create neural networks\n",
    "- Deep learning: we move to deep networks, the basis for all of the recent advancements, such as generative models and GPT models\n",
    "- Image classification: we will train an image classifier on a number of small tasks\n",
    "- Image segmentation: we discuss image segmentation in the context of medicine\n",
    "- Pre-trained models: use networks that have already been trained\n",
    "- Fine-tuning models: adapt a pre-trained network to your specific task \n",
    "- Model deployment and web application development\n",
    "- Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as mentioned, this course we are going to be using Jupyter almost exclusively. We have set up a server so that you can follow along with the examples that we cover here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server can be accessed via a link that will be shown on the projector now!\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not worry if there is some warning about insecure HTTP: access to this server is limited to the MUG network and KAGes. No one else can access this server from outside of the MUG or the KAGes network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To log in, use s + matriculation number, e.g. `s07316801` and the password that will be shown on the whiteboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you log in, you will see the notebooks for the course. If you do not see any notebooks, then something went wrong! Most likely you have entered an incorrect matriculation number. Let's make sure everyone is logged in before we continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this server will only be running during the seminar times! Outside of seminar times, you can download the notebooks from the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of the seminar times, you will need to either install Jupyter on your machines, or use one of the online services that we will cover later in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now however, we will use this server for the next two days during the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The material (for example these notebooks, plus other material from the R part of the course, and datasets and so on) are all available at any time under the following link:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <https://github.com/imigraz/ATSP-2024>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at the repository now. You can download the contents of the repository as a zip file, or you can clone the repository using Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have time, there are some small exercises along the way that you can complete. However, because it is unclear if we will have time for these, the grading will be based only the assignment that you have to complete."

    "# Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment that we are using now is called Jupyter. It provides an interactive web-based environment called notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that Jupyter is not just for Python development. There are so-called kernels from dozens of languags, see <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels>, including R. Also, Jupyter is used widely in acaedmia to disseminate results and experiments. It is therefore a very useful tool to aid reproducibility. A particularly good example of this can be found here: <https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3051> - you will find that there are a number of Jupyter notebooks associated with the paper, and they can be used to reproduce the exact same plots found with in the paper itself: <https://github.com/theandygross/TCGA/>. If you supply your experiments as a Jupyter notebook, anyone can download the notebooks, and run them on their local machine, confirming your results. This can greatly enhance your chances of getting a paper published! \n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub natively supports Jupyter, so you can host notebooks for free there. Example: <https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor/blob/master/notebooks/Augmentor_Keras.ipynb>. GitHub is often used to host Jupyter notebooks for a publication, as we saw above. Note that GitHub hosts notebooks **statically**, meaning they cannot be executed. You can view them, and download them, but not run them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the structure of a notebook. Notebooks can contain text, images, and also code. When you execute Python code, the code is sent to a server (which can running on your local machine or elsewhere), and the results or output of the code appear in the notebook.\n",

For example in Python you can write GUI applications, web applications, server-side applications, as well as use it for systems administration, machine learning, or statistics. It is a very broad language.\n",

    "## Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 collection types in Python, and you will come across all of them in Machine Learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of collections as lists of items, and each of the 4 collection types have their own distinct properties and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 collection types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are unsurprinsingly lists of objects. They can be numerical or text, or mixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists are **mutable**, that means they can be changed after they have been declared. \n",
    "- Lists are **ordered**, meaning their order is defined meaning they will maintain the order in which you added the elements, unless you explicitly change this. \n",
    "- You create lists by placing items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.\n",
    "- Lists **allow duplicates**: they can contain multiple occurrences of the same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use lists when you have a collection of items where order matters and you might need to change the items (add, remove, or change).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are like mathematical sets. Here are some of the properties of sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable**: You can add or remove elements from a set\n",
    "- **Unordered**: Sets do not record element position or order of insertion. Why might ask why? This can make them very fast and are useful for containing many millions of elements.\n",
    "- You create sets by placing items inside curly brackets {}, or using the `set()` function.\n",
    "- **Duplicates are not allowed**: A set cannot contain multiple occurrences of the same element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: Use sets when you need to ensure that an element only appears once in a collection, often used for membership testing, removing duplicates (if you convert a list in to a set, you can very quickly get all unique elements in the list with one quick statement). Also, they are used for mathematical set operations, such as intersection, union, and difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are different in that they are arranged in key-value pairs. We will see dictionaries often later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable: You can change, add, or delete key-value pairs after the dictionary is created.\n",
    "- Ordered, since Python 3.7 - generally this does not matter, as dictionaries are normally accessed via their keys.\n",
    "- Syntax: Created with curly brackets {} containing key-value pairs separated by colons, in the form {'key': 'value'}.\n",
    "- **Unique Keys**: The keys have to be unique, but values can be duplicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: Use dictionaries when you need to associate a  unique key with a values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see dictionaries used a lot during the course, but here is an example, so that it is clear what we mean by key-value pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = {'name': 'marcus', 'age': 21}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access a particular value using its key, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d['name']\n",
    ">>> marcus\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable (unchangeable), ordered, and can contain duplicate items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, you cannot change it, cannot add elements to it, or remove elements from it\n",
    "- Ordered: The items have a defined order\n",
    "- Syntax: Created by placing items inside parentheses `()`, separated by commas\n",
    "- Duplicates are allowed: Tuples can contain multiple occurrences of the same element\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: Use tuples when you have an ordered collection of items that should never change! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "So you should of course all be aware of if, else, elif:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if a < b:\n",
    "    print('Computer says no')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Computer says yes')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if a == '+':\n",
    "    op = PLUS\n",
    "elif a == '-':\n",
    "    op = MINUS\n",
    "elif a == '*':\n",
    "    op = TIMES\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    op = UNKNOWN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop in Python is most common type of loop. It simply iterates over all elements of a list for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will see this many times, during the seminar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looping over a list, a very useful function to know is `enumerate()`. This goes over the entire list, but also returns its index. I will cover this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the `while` loop, which we do not come across during this seminar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are very similar to those in R or other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "You define a new function using `def`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello {name}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and call a function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_function('marcus')\n",
    ">>> Hello marcus\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages are available via the *Python Package Index*, know simply as *PyPI* and packages can be installed using `pip`, which installs packages from the PyPI repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can take a look at the PyPI now: <https://pypi.org>\n",
    "\n",
    "You install a package using the `pip install` command, so for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ pip insall numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before you install anything, you should be aware of virtual enviroments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended that you create virtual environments for each of your projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a virtual environment? Basically it is an isolated Python environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the `python` command from the command line, you are running the system-side installed Python environment. It is recommended that you do not really install many packages to the system Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead you should use virtual environments. Basically, for each project that you are working on, you should use a seperate virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do this? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some projects will require many different packages, and some packages depend on certain verions of other packages. If, for example, a package requires version 1.5 of NumPy, but another project requires at most version 1.4, then you will have a dependency conflict and these can be difficult to solve. Therefore, it is much easier to manage smaller virtual environments for each project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a virtual environment using Python's built-in `venv` tool. You want to do this in the root directory of your current project. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python -m venv my-new-virtual-env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new virtual enviroment called `my-new-virtual-env` in the current directory, under the directory `./my-new-virtual-env`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this `./my-new-virtual-env` there is a new, fresh Python environment. All you need to do now is declare this virtual environment as active:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ source ./my-new-virtual-env/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or in Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cmd\n",
    "myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and your virtual environment will now be active. Anything you do within this environment will not affect the system version of Python, nor will it affect any other virtual enviroment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will know you are in a virtual enviroment, as your command line shell will change its appearance, and look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(my-new-virtual-env) $\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the name of the current virtual environment will appears before the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few tips that you should be aware of that I have found useful after many years of Python programming :) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Interactive Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "You know you can run Python scripts from the command line using: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python my_script.py\n",
    "hello world\n",
    "$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it can be difficult to debug these scripts, as if you encounter an error, the script will terminate and you will be dumped back to the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is much more useful is to use `-i` to run a script in interactive mode: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python -i my_script.py\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs the script, but keeps you within an interactive session, so that you can inspect variables and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping Over A Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a list of colours: `[\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"orange\"]` and you wanted to loop over it, you might be inclined to write something like:"

    "What is Numpy? You can think of it like an extension for Python which adds support for large matrix and array manipulation. It also provides a large amount of functions to work with these arrays, which we will see shortly. If you know MATLAB, then Numpy will seem very familiar to you. As opposed to Pandas, which deals with Excel style data, tabular data and so on, Numpy deals with numerical data only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays and Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are arrays and matrices?\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is just a list of numbers. You might also know it has a vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3, 5, ..., n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices can be 2D or multi-dimensional. They are also called **axes** in Numpy parlance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a standard array is 1-dimensional, and is basically a list like the list we saw above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2D array is like a table (you can think of it as a list of 1D arrays), and is synonymous with a matrix in mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3D array has a depth dimension.  You can kind of think of it as a list of 2D arrays, and can be considered a tensor in mathematics.\n",

    "*Source*: <https://jovian.com/anujadp4/python-numerical-computing-with-numpy>\n",

    "Numpy is n-dimensional, so you can go to even further dimensions, for example a 4D array is a list of 3D arrays, and so on. After about 4 dimensions it becomes a bit difficult to parse in termsof the syntax, which we will see momentarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of data in your machine learning tasks are going to be either supplied to you as Numpy data, or you will manipulate this data  using Numpy, or the software or algorithms will require input as Numpy data. Therefore, it is an essential skill.\n",

    "As mentioned, I am aware that Pandas was covered but if a refresher is required we can cover it now before the afternoon session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting any of our Machine Learning material, we will cover the two most commonly used packages for handling and manipulating data, namely Numpy and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Numpy as an array and matrix manipulation library (if you are familiar with MATLAB, it provides much of the functionality of MATLAB). \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas, on the other hand, provides the functionality of R's data frames, or you could think of it as Excel for Python. It allows you to manipulate data stored in Excel-like spreadsheets, in a programmatic way. Pandas is best suited for this type of **tabular** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, unlike NumPy, Pandas DataFrames have column names for example, and you can access individual columns using the column name, while in NumPy you access columns using indices. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is also used for multi-dimensional data or $n$-dimensional arrays, as we saw previously, while Pandas is for tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Pandas DataFrames are convenient if you get your data from doctors here the LKH or MUG, as you will likeyly receive your data as Excel, and Pandas provides convient ways of importing this data using functions such as `read_excel()`. You can also open SAS, SPSS, and SQL databases."
